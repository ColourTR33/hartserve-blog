# Enterprise AI Design Patterns

## Executive Summary
This document provides architectural designs and recommendations for integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the enterprise. It outlines specific AI-powered functionalities, presents core architectural principles for a robust and scalable AI ecosystem, and details a strategic approach to AI DevOps, cost management, and system design for complex AI patterns like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The guiding philosophy is to use AI as a tool to augment human expertise, improve efficiency, ensure consistency, and reduce risk, while maintaining strict human oversight and control.
